## Intro

Ketchup is a web components library, built with [Ionicâ€™s Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/), a TypeScript based web component compiler.

`Web Components` is a suite of different technologies allowing to create reusable custom elements that you can use in your web apps. For more information visit this link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components

The primary focus of Ketchup is to provide a suite of powerful and customizable Web Components, whose main objective is abstracting complex and recurrent programming patterns.

## Showcase
