        The field component is designed to work as a simple form or to be used
        inside the Form component. Its layout is composed by an optional label,
        an optional submit button and, more importantly, another Ketchup
        component.
        <br />This is the list of all the components currently supported (with
        their prefix).
      </p>
      <p>
        - Combobox (
        <span class="code-word">cmb</span>
        )
        <br />- Radio (
        <span class="code-word">rad</span>
        )
        <br />- Text field (
        <span class="code-word">itx</span>
        )
        <br />
        <br />To select a component, the
        <span class="code-word">type</span> prop must be set using the
        component's prefix and the <span class="code-word">data</span> prop must
        contain the component's props.
